# Story Generator V2 ⚔️

A fun Python script that creates a simple story using user input.  
Written and developed from scratch by myself as part of my Python learning journey.

## 📌 What it does
- Asks the user to enter:
  - A main character's name
  - A friend’s name
  - A city
  - A type of enemy
- Generates a short story using that input

## 🧠 Purpose
I created this project to practice:
- `input()` for taking user data
- `f-string` formatting in Python
- Writing logic for dynamic storytelling
- Structuring a project by myself

## 💡 How to run
Make sure Python is installed. Then run:

```bash
python story_generator_v2.py
